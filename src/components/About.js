            <p className="w-50 mt-4 text-justify">My name is Camila, I'm 21 years old and I live in Sogamoso, Colombia. I went to college in the US and graduated May of 2020 with a Bachelor's Degree in Business. I started my coding journey at the beginning of 2020 and I have also been studying at Academlo, a coding bootcamp (fullstack-oriented), for the last three months. I have become comfortable using HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, as well as writing vanilla JavaScript and I'm currently learning React. I also have some knowledge of Python and MySQL.<br/>

            While I was studying business, one of the things I struggled most was how to showcase my skills. In my search for something that I could create I came across R and data science, from then I started looking deeper into programming in general. These last few months have shown me so much about the community around programming and the fun that coding something from scratch can be, almost magical âœ¨.
